The Apache Wave project is a stand alone wave server and rich web editor and
multiple platform clients that serves as a Wave reference implementation.

This project lets developers and enterprise users run wave servers and
host waves on their own hardware. And then share those waves with other
wave servers through federation.

The Apache Wave project is a distributed, near-real-time, rich collaboration
platform that allows users to work together in new and exciting ways. Wave
allows for flexible modes of communication, blending chat, email and
collaborative document editing in to one seamless environment. Wave provides a
lively and responsive environment that promotes more fluid and dynamic
collaboration between users.
